# Streak-Fit-1
Project for Build-a-thon (Domain : Healthcare, E-Technologies)

## Problem Statement

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic gyms, parks, and other physical training facilities worldwide
have been shut down for a long period. It has become difficult for health-conscious people to
interact and exercise with their peers. As a result, the physical fitness and health among the
work-from-home folks have degraded over time. Also, without the proper environment, people
feel lonely and find it difficult to stay motivated to exercise. 

## Our Solution

Our solution presents a virtual gym community where people can join a private video chat room
and exercise with their mates. It would keep a track of oneâ€™s daily fitness activities and also host
exercise competitions among peers. We plan to leverage the power of AI/ML to track various
exercises movements and yoga postures to ensure fairness during virtual fitness competitions.
Our pose detection algorithm shall take care of the counts and exercise postures so that users
can freely exercise with their peers.
